### Background

You work at a startup that is building a new and disruptive platform called Fintech Finder. Fintech Finder is an application that its customers can use to find fintech professionals from among a list of candidates, hire them, and pay them. As Fintech Finder’s lead developer, you have been tasked with integrating the Ethereum blockchain network into the application in order to enable your customers to instantly pay the fintech professionals whom they hire with cryptocurrency.

In this Challenge, you will complete the code that enables your customers to send cryptocurrency payments to fintech professionals. To develop the code and test it out, you will assume the perspective of a Fintech Finder customer who is using the application to find a fintech professional and pay them for their work.

### What You're Creating

To complete this Challenge, you will use two Python files, both of which are contained in the starter folder.

The first file that you will use is called `fintech_finder.py`. It contains the code associated with the web interface of your application. The code included in this file is compatible with the Streamlit library. You will write all of your code for this Challenge in this file.

The second file that you will use is called `crypto_wallet.py`. This file contains the Ethereum transaction functions that you have created throughout this module’s lessons. By using import statements, you will integrate the `crypto_wallet.py` Python script into the Fintech Finder interface program that is found in the `fintech_finder.py` file.

Integrating these two files will allow you to automate the tasks associated with generating a digital wallet, accessing Ethereum account balances, and signing and sending transactions via a personal Ethereum blockchain called Ganache.

Specifically, you will assume the perspective of a Fintech Finder customer in order to do the following:

* Generate a new Ethereum account instance by using the mnemonic seed phrase provided by Ganache.

* Fetch and display the account balance associated with your Ethereum account address.

* Calculate the total value of an Ethereum transaction, including the gas estimate, that pays a Fintech Finder candidate for their work.

* Digitally sign a transaction that pays a Fintech Finder candidate, and send this transaction to the Ganache blockchain.

* Review the transaction hash code associated with the validated blockchain transaction.

Once you receive the transaction’s hash code, you will navigate to the Transactions section of Ganache to review the blockchain transaction details. To confirm that you have successfully created the transaction, you will save screenshots to the README.md file of your GitHub repository for this Challenge assignment.

# Instructions 

# 1. From your terminal, navigate to the project folder that contains
# your `.env` file and the `krypto_jobs.py` and `crypto_wallet.py` files.
# Be sure to activate your Conda `dev` environment if it is not already active.

# 2. To launch the Streamlit application,
# type `streamlit run krypto_jobs.py`.

# 3. On the resulting webpage, select a candidate that you would like to hire
# from the appropriate drop-down menu. Then, enter the number of hours that you
# would like to hire them for. (Remember, you do not have a lot of ether in
# your account, so you cannot hire them for long!)

# 4 Click the Send Transaction button to sign and send the transaction with
# your Ethereum account information. If the transaction is successfully
# communicated to Ganache, validated, and added to a block,
# a resulting transaction hash code will be written to the Streamlit
# application sidebar.

The first time I tried to send the transaction I got this error but found that the error had to do with my `crypto_wallet.py` on the `line 72` gas price. 


Once I input the gas price '875000000' my transaction was successful.


# 5. Navigate to the Ganache accounts tab and locate your account (index 0).
# * Take a screenshot of the address, balance, and transaction (TX) count.
# Save this screenshot to the README.md file of your GitHub repository for
#  this Challenge assignment.



# 6. Navigate to the Ganache transactions tab and locate the transaction.
# * Click the transaction and take a screenshot of it.
# Save this screenshot to the README.md file of your GitHub repository for
#  this Challenge assignment.
